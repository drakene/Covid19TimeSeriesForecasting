This is a project made in Python which aims to forecast the growth of Covid-19 infections in the United States. 
I aim to use different methods of building regression models to understand how the virus is spreading at any 
given point in time. The utility of the project is not for the public, but rather just a way for me to practice 
data science skills and programming in Python.
